# CoC-2ndbase-attack-spammer
This very simple python script spams witch attacks on the 2nd base to farm gold and elixir.

**Installation**
This script works using the _pyautogui_ module to handle clicks in different positions of the screen.
<pre>
    pip install pyautogui
</pre>

**Usage**
The most important thing is to run _Bluestacks X_ on default size and with the window positioned in the top-left corner otherwise the script won't make clicks in the correct positions.
After having installed the script file, open cmd, ensure you have the latest version of python using:
<pre>
    python --version
</pre>
after that when you have prepared the bluestacks window you can start the script using:
<pre>
    python cocfarminf.py
</pre>
the script will switch window to bluestacks and start running attacks.

**Preparing the army**
Prepare the army with 6 witches and the script will place all of them + the war machine in an angle and activate their powerups.
